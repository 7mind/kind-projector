The goal of this plugin is to rewrite things like:

  Either[?, Double]
  Tuple3[Int, ?, ?]

into type projections like:

  ({type L_kp[X_kp0] = Either[X_kp0, Double]})#L_kp
  ({type L_kp[X_kp1, X_kp2] = Tuple3[Int, X_kp1, X_kp2]})#L_kp

For various reasons I've been using make to develop the plugin. Here are some
various make targets:

  make plugin        compile and assemble the plugin jar
  make test          (try to) compile the test code
  make tree          print the tree of the test code
  make clean         delete jar, class files, etc

There are more targets--the Makefile should be fairly readable.
